Code for having a joystick to controll a microcontroller from MadCity labs with a serial number : RM21 Classic MCL-uS2671, LP200: MCLS04446.

You should be able to use the app in the releases directly, if not you can compile the code yourself by just using the makefile.

Permits to control presisely the displacement by controlling how much the stage should move when pressing a button.
When using continuous move the stage will stop when you release the button.
Press the stop button to stop the stage.

In the menu you can find:
Reset_axis -> set the axis to (0,0,0)
Go home -> Go the the (0,0,0) position using a fast 3 axes movement, 
Reset Axis -> Make full range of motion displacement to go back to the center of the stage.
